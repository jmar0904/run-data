# run-data

Data files contain data gathered from 2019 to present. Data from 2019 through April 10,2020 was primarily recorded on Nike Running app. Some runs were recorded on Strava or MapMyRun. 

After April 10, 2020 I began collecting data on my Garmin Forerunner 245. This includes far more data, including heart rate, sleep, other actvities like cycling and swimming, and more. 

The csv files with the prefix "Health Data Reformat" contain data from my daily run log, which I manually input after each run. I also have csv files dating back to 2013, which were primarily generated with my Nike Running app and manually added to a spreadsheet.
